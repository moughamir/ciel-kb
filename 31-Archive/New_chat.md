Why does dogs and cats hate each other 

### Assistant:
Dogs and cats don't necessarily hate each other by default. However, they can have natural differences in behavior and communication styles that can sometimes lead to conflicts or misunderstandings. For example, dogs are often more social and pack-oriented, while cats are generally more independent. Additionally, their body language and ways of interacting can be different, which might cause tension or fear between them. That said, many dogs and cats can learn to coexist peacefully and even form close bonds with each other if given proper introductions, socialization, and a safe environment.
