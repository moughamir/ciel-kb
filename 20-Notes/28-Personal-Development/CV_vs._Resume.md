What is Difference between a cc and a resume?

### Assistant:
A CV (curriculum vitae) and a resume are both documents used for job applications, but they serve different purposes. 

A CV is typically longer and more detailed, often used in academic, research, or medical fields. It provides a comprehensive overview of your education, work experience, publications, presentations, awards, and other relevant information. CVs are commonly used in countries outside of North America.

On the other hand, a resume is usually shorter and tailored specifically to the job you're applying for. It highlights your key skills, work experience, and accomplishments related to the position. Resumes are commonly used in North America and are more concise, focusing on relevant qualifications and achievements.

In summary, a CV provides a comprehensive overview of your professional history and achievements, while a resume is a concise document tailored to a specific job application.
