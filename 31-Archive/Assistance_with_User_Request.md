Best way to make my whatsapp contact interact with my stories and status update as auto-entrepreneur web developer

### Assistant:
As an auto-entrepreneur web developer, it's important to make sure your contacts on WhatsApp are aware of your updates and stories. Here are some tips on how to encourage interaction:

1. Post regularly: Make sure you post updates and stories regularly, so your contacts see that you are active on WhatsApp. This will help keep you top of mind.

2. Make your updates interesting: When you post an update or story, make sure it's something your contacts will find interesting. Share your latest project, showcase your skills, or give a behind-the-scenes look at your work process.

3. Use visuals: Use photos or videos in your updates and stories. Visuals are more eye-catching than plain text, and can help your updates stand out.

4. Ask questions: Ask your contacts questions
