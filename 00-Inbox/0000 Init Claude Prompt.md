# Project: [[Cognitive Internet]]

## Objective

To build a decentralized, high-performance [[AI]] cluster. This project, known as the [[Cognitive Internet]], will be optimized for a custom, decentralized [[AI]] ecosystem.

## Key Areas of Development

1.  **Workspace & Repository:**
    *   Design a `[[monorepo]]` structure for all project components.
    *   Include [[Rust]] crates, [[Docker]] environments, [[Kubernetes]] configurations, and [[CI/CD]] pipelines.

2.  **Hardware Specification:**
    *   Define minimum hardware for a 3-node prototype cluster.
    *   Focus on `[[Libreboot]]` compatibility, 10GbE networking, and [[AI]] accelerators.

3.  **Custom [[Linux]] OS:**
    *   Develop an automated build system for a custom [[Linux]] distribution.
    *   The OS will be optimized for real-time performance and minimal footprint.

4.  **Node Software Architecture:**
    *   Design and build the core node software in [[Rust]].
    *   Components include networking, [[blockchain]] integration, [[AI]] runtime, and an API gateway.

5.  **[[P2P]] Networking:**
    *   Implement a decentralized networking layer using `[[libp2p]]`.
    *   Focus on peer discovery, secure communication, and various message types.

6.  **[[AI]] Runtime & Model Management:**
    *   Design an [[AI]] execution environment supporting multiple engines like [[Ollama]].
    *   Implement decentralized model distribution using [[IPFS]] and [[BitTorrent]].

7.  **Cluster Orchestration:**
    *   Create a decentralized orchestration system for load balancing and health monitoring.
    *   Include a system for benchmarking and rating [[AI]] models.

8.  **Development Environment:**
    *   Set up a `[[docker-compose]]` based development environment for a 3-node cluster.
    *   Include monitoring and testing tools.

9.  **Security:**
    *   Implement security layers for cryptographic identity, network security, and [[blockchain]] integration.

10. **Monitoring & Observability:**
    *   Design a comprehensive monitoring system using [[Prometheus]], [[Grafana]], and [[OpenTelemetry]].
