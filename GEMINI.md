# Directory Overview

This directory is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, a personal knowledge base for managing notes and ideas. The structure follows a variation of the Zettelkasten method, with directories organized by topic and status.

The central theme of this vault appears to be the **Cognitive Internet Project**, a project to create a distributed, self-governing mesh of AI nodes. Other topics include startup ideas, technical projects, AI/ML research, content creation, and personal notes.

## Key Directories and Files

    *   `00 Index.md`: The main index of the knowledge base, providing a table of contents for all major topics.
*   **99-Templates/**: A directory for note templates to maintain consistency across the vault.
*   **assets/**, **attachements/**: These directories likely store images, PDFs, and other attachments linked within the notes.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be used with the Obsidian application. To use it:

1.  Download and install Obsidian from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
2.  Open Obsidian and select "Open folder as vault".
3.  Navigate to this directory and open it.

The notes are written in Markdown and can be linked together to create a network of knowledge. The `00 Index.md` file in the `40-Summary-Notes` directory is a good starting point for exploring the contents of this vault.
