# Cognitive Internet Project

The Cognitive Internet Project is a project to create a distributed, self-governing mesh of AI nodes. The goal is to create a global, cooperative AI fabric where each node contributes compute, stores encrypted model shards, and validates updates via cryptographic proofs recorded on a public ledger.

## Key Concepts

- **Cognitive Internet Layer (CIL):** A logical overlay that binds together hardware, firmware, kernel, runtime, mesh, storage, and governance layers.
- **Trust-Weighted Participation Factor:** A formula to determine a node's participation based on its reputation.
- **Federated Update Rule:** An extended federated learning update rule that incorporates the trust-weighted participation factor.

## Sub-Projects
